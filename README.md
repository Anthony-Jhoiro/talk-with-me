*Yes, I don't know if anybody tried to manage a minecraft mod with NX yet, but I did, and it works fine **most of the time***

This project is wrapped around a minecraft mod. It adds several mobs (aka *neighbors* or *friends*, I'am not sure of the right semantic yet.
Each of them have their own personality and interracts with the player by messages generated by AI. This way, each experience is uniq.

I currently use MistralIA API for my model ðŸ¥–.

Details about the mobs personality are available in the `data/neighbors` directory.

The repository is composed of 3 projects managed by NX.
- The minecraft mod
- A server that handles all the AI logic, message retention and all (*tech: Spring boot*)
- An admin interface to test the neighbors without launching the minecraft mod. (*tech: Vu3+Vite*)

The project still runs with Java 17 since Java 21 is not supported in minecraft 1.20.1 (the version that I currently use)


The mod is not ready to be launched right now, I currently use it mostly to benchmark different AI models.

If you are interrested in the project, feel free to contact me or to create an issue!
